# Error-detection-in-networks
1. Assume Sender A is transmitting a packet made of four 16-bit words (A7A2)16, (CABF)16, (903A)16, (A123)16 to Receiver B. Apply the appropriate error detection mechanism that involves binary addition to compute the codewords at the receiver end.

2. Implement the appropriate error detection mechanism to compute the codeword at the sender side for the given dataword, 101001111 using the polynomial generator, x4+x2+x+1.
